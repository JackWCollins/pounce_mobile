PouncePro Mobile App Hosted on Heroku
===

This repo is to host the mobile app on Heroku for demo purposes. It is live at pouncepro-mobile.herokuapp.com

I used two articles to help get this up and running:

I used the sparse checkout in the above link to create a separate repo of only the mobile version of PouncePro. That allowed me to create a standalone Heroku deployment for demos.

This link was for setting up an Express server to host the javascript files.
